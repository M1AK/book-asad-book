# Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI & Basic Robotics

Welcome to the first chapter of the "Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics Handbook"!

In this chapter, we will embark on an exciting journey into the world where artificial intelligence meets the physical realm. We'll explore the fundamental concepts that bridge the gap between intelligent software and robotic hardware, laying the groundwork for you to build and program your own physical AI systems.

This chapter will cover:
*   What Physical AI is and its distinction from traditional AI.
*   The essential role of robotics in bringing AI into physical existence.
*   The basic hardware components that make up a robot.
*   The software tools and programming concepts needed to make robots move and interact with their environment.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of the core principles of Physical AI and robotics, and you'll be ready to dive into the hands-on projects that follow. Let's get started!
