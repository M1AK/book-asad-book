# Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics Handbook Project

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the "Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics Handbook". The handbook is built using Docusaurus, a static site generator.

## Getting Started with the Handbook (Docusaurus Site)

To set up the Docusaurus development environment and build the handbook locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Navigate to the Docusaurus Project Directory

The Docusaurus site is located in the `physical-ai-handbook/` subdirectory.

```bash
cd physical-ai-handbook
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary Node.js dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or if you use Yarn
# yarn install
```

### 3. Start the Development Server

To start the local development server and view the handbook in your browser:

```bash
npm run start
# or if you use Yarn
# yarn start
```

This will open the site in your default web browser (usually at `http://localhost:3000`). Any changes you make to the content will automatically refresh in the browser.

### 4. Build the Static Site

To build the static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for deployment:

```bash
npm run build
# or if you use Yarn
# yarn build
```

The generated static files will be placed in the `physical-ai-handbook/build/` directory.
